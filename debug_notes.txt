Hi everyone,

I was able to install Docker Desktop and enable Kubernetes without issues. It seems like they are running fine. Also. I installed the Ubuntu distribution on WSL-2, but I noticed kubernetes and the ubuntu distro are using a lot of memory already (around ~5GB). Is there a way to limit the resources for this services? According to documentation, there should be a file under "C:\Users\<UserName>\.wslconfig." to configure the limitis (memory, cpu, swap size), but the file is missing on my Windows machine. Have anyone seen this issue?

You may have to create the file if it is not there. The file I created is pasted below. 

Later in the course you will probably need 6G or more, when we build data pipelines. My understanding (according to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#configure-global-options-with-wslconfigðŸ˜ž WSL2 defaults to "50% of total memory on Windows or 8GB, whichever is less;"

[wsl2]

memory=6GB

swap=0
